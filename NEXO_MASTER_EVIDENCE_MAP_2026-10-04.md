# NEXO MASTER EVIDENCE MAP — 2026-10-04

## Purpose
Recovery index to prevent continuity loss. This file is an inventory map, not a new AB checkpoint and does not replace AB105.116R.

## Recovery rules
- Never promote temporal order to JMM happens-before.
- Never treat a documented run as raw evidence unless its artifact/log is recoverable.
- Never rerun TLC while the ordering audit is open.
- Never create a new AB105.117R.
- Do not repeat an experiment already closed unless the raw evidence is missing and a distinct recovery question exists.
- Classify findings: VERIFIED / OBSERVED / TEMPORAL / UNKNOWN / CONFLICT / SUPERSEDED / DUPLICATE.

## Canonical protected boundary
- AB105.116R remains the protected research anchor.
- Kafka experiment pin: 99b940733a9f6bc409457dba7108f08421d81e42.
- Current G0 ordering boundary: f2b8298e1fb1aec9044df6ad048b3fe6d7b877ce.
- Current JMM snapshot audit checkpoint: d6c2ac31843861bf02a6bb793a5ceb6336e0dd7e.
- No new AB105.117R created by this recovery map.

## Major recovered evidence families

### AB104 foundation / safety model
Recovered continuity shows a large AB104 chain and repeated audit checkpoints. Important fixed findings:
- AB104.197: valid CommitRecord -> reconstruction, not handler replay.
- AB104.212: crash != execution result.
- AB104.368: authority A and target T are independent; A VALID + T UNKNOWN => UNKNOWN/STOP; A UNKNOWN + T VALID => UNKNOWN/STOP.
- AB104.728: reducer error coverage UNKNOWN.
- GLOBAL-AUDIT-109: STOP REQUESTED != ENFORCED; REVOCATION ISSUED != ENFORCED EVERYWHERE; AUTH CACHE HIT != CURRENT AUTHORITY; FENCE ISSUED != ENFORCED.
- AB104.741+ continuity commits and later AB104.768R show multiple recovery/fork corrections. These must be treated as historical evidence to reconcile, not blindly as the current anchor.

### AB105 minimum model / TLC
- AB105.111R: RECIBIDO != ADMITIDO; finite minimum model; authority/STOP/fence/effects/replay/reconstruction/atomicity/UNKNOWN.
- AB105.112R: finite-space audit; UNKNOWN reachable; SAFE_WAIT != illegal deadlock.
- Historical TLC: run 36781846063 / job 110113752493; commit ec15…; TypeOK cartesian upper bound 4.46e18; several declared states were unreachable.
- TLC is FROZEN for the current ordering audit.

### G0 runtime progression
PR chain recovered:
- #79 compile observability gate.
- #80 runtime execution gate.
- #81 corrected pinned-Kafka API compile gate; D1 must use real authorization path.
- #82 controlled 2-broker discriminator.
- #83 NEW D1 before target-local ACL revocation.
- #84 new-request timing experiment; did not complete full witness.
- #85 metadata warmup correction; not independent evidence.
- #86 isolates WRITE revocation from DESCRIBE metadata authorization.
- #87/#88/#89 JMM diagnostic family.
- #90/#91 harness validation/type fixes.
- #92 cache-identity diagnostic.
- #93 exact authorize snapshot diagnostic.
- #94 real-broker ordering witness.
- #95 100-cycle visibility sample; historical run reference not currently recoverable.
- #96 producer-prewarm latency diagnostic; no associated head-SHA workflow run found.

### Real-broker raw evidence
- Run 370778: 240 NEXO_ORDER events / 10 cycles; ordering markers observed.
- Artifact: 11265332252; SHA-256 d8a9e021e02871a3158b1ce0e88e7fae34b33ba5a804f9375a5fd8b20f878a7c.
- 140/140 markers reconciled.
- 10/10 cycles: W1 < D1 ENQUEUE < DEQUEUE < AUTH_ENTER < AUTH_DECISION=DENIED.
- The 20 ENQUEUE/DEQUEUE/AUTH markers were reconciled: 10 D1 and 10 later ALLOWED requests.
- Cycles 7 and 9 showed a second ACL_W1 after D0_RETURN; therefore D0_RETURN != W1.
- W1 < ENQUEUE is temporal only; no W1 -> producer/request happens-before was established.

### Exact aclCache / authorization path
Pinned source audit recovered:
- authorize() -> findAclRule().
- Exact read: AclCache aclCacheSnapshot = aclCache.
- Same snapshot reference is used through the authorization operation.
- W1 creates a new immutable cache and assigns aclCache = new snapshot.
- aclCache is plain/non-volatile.
- Therefore the precise unresolved question is whether a later authorization can legally observe the older cache object across the publication boundary.
Status:
- exact read site: VERIFIED
- single snapshot per authorization: VERIFIED
- stale snapshot observed: NOT OBSERVED
- stale snapshot impossible: UNKNOWN
- W1 -> authorization JMM HB: UNKNOWN
- security impact: UNKNOWN / NOT ESTABLISHED

### PR #93 executed JMM snapshot diagnostic
Run 37040417803 / job 110948877687; pinned Kafka.
Latest canonical checkpoint records:
- 100 iterations, 4 readers.
- 2,939,007 observations.
- POST_RETURN_ALLOWED=0.
- POST_RETURN_PRE_REMOVE_CACHE=0.
- POST_RETURN_PRE_REMOVE_SNAPSHOT=0.
- POST_RETURN_POST_REMOVE_SNAPSHOT=2,845,069.
- UNEXPECTED=0.
Interpretation: no post-return stale snapshot or post-return ALLOWED was observed in this diagnostic. This is executed evidence, not a formal JMM proof and not a real-broker exploit witness.
Known historical count discrepancy (older note reported 4,071,307 observations) remains a reconciliation item; latest saved checkpoint is canonical until raw artifact is recovered.

### Producer -> broker causal gap
Recovered source/audit conclusion:
- test thread calls producer.send() after D0_RETURN.
- KafkaProducer.send() is asynchronous/buffered.
- request later reaches broker networking / RequestChannel.
- W1 occurs on MetadataLoader/AclPublisher callback path.
- RequestChannel queue publication establishes producer-thread -> request-handler publication for actions before ENQUEUE, but does not create a universal metadata-thread -> RPC-authorizer HB edge.
- No identified production synchronization closes W1 -> authorization globally for incremental aclCache publication.
Status: temporal witness VERIFIED; causal/JMM edge UNKNOWN.

### Append / E path
Recovered source trace:
handleProduceRequest -> authorization -> authorizedRequestInfo -> ReplicaManager.handleProduceAppend -> appendRecords -> appendToLocalLog / UnifiedLog.appendAsLeader.
No second generic TOPIC ACL authorization was identified between the request authorization result and append.
The E accessor compiles against pinned Kafka using BrokerServer.logManager().getLog(...).map(UnifiedLog::logEndOffset), but the referenced compile-only gate did not invoke the exact accessor.
Therefore the missing full chain remains:
W1 -> stale snapshot -> D1 ALLOWED -> same request -> append/E increment.
Status: UNKNOWN.

## Historical artifacts that must NOT be counted as fresh evidence
- Run 370790 is documented in later continuity text, but direct run/jobs/artifact lookup currently returned 404 and search did not recover the raw artifact.
- Therefore 370790 is historical/documented only until independently recovered.
- PR #95/#96 head SHAs currently have no associated workflow runs through fetch_commit_workflow_runs; this does not prove that no other historical SHA/workflow execution exists.

## Known contradictions / recovery targets
1. AB104 continuity contains many sequential checkpoint commits plus later fork/collision corrections. Need a chronological graph, not a single linear list.
2. PR #93 observation count discrepancy: 4,071,307 vs 2,939,007. Latest checkpoint is canonical pending raw-artifact reconciliation.
3. Historical 117R references exist in archaeology, but this map must not create a new 117R.
4. Documented run != recoverable raw artifact.
5. D0_RETURN != W1.
6. W1 < ENQUEUE != W1 HB D1.
7. No stale observation != stale observation impossible.

## Recovery work still pending
- Build chronological graph of AB104/AB105 continuity commits.
- Map every PR to its parent/child experiment family and deduplicate.
- Map every documented workflow run to recoverable raw artifact, or explicitly mark unrecoverable.
- Reconcile all count discrepancies.
- Identify all claims that were later superseded or contradicted.
- Produce a final evidence matrix: CLAIM -> SOURCE -> RUN -> ARTIFACT -> RECONCILIATION -> STATUS -> NEXT TEST.

## DO-NOT-REPEAT
- Do not rerun TLC.
- Do not repeat PR #93 exact 100-iteration snapshot diagnostic.
- Do not repeat PR #92 cache census.
- Do not add latch/volatile/barrier/Future gate.
- Do not equate D0_RETURN with W1.
- Do not promote W1 < ENQUEUE to JMM HB.
- Do not claim vulnerability or safety without the missing causal chain.
