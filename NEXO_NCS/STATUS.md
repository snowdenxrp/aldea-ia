# NEXO NCS — STATUS

## Current phase
CONSTRUCTION — STEP 6 RECONCILIATION BOUNDARY

## Closed / runtime verified
- STEP 3A isolation: runtime verified.
- STEP 3B protected-transition composition: runtime verified.
- STEP 3C canonical persistState conditional commit integration: runtime verified.
- STEP 4 final semantic validation: runtime verified in GitHub Actions.
- STEP 5 outcome classification: runtime verified in GitHub Actions (run 37785361553).

## STEP 4 verified evidence
- Workflow run: 37784767180
- Job: 113336577540
- Commit: 8cb6ea83dc8ba70bbbd9abfd7ff763b801720576
- Node.js: 22.23.3
- Conclusion: success.

Verified semantics include claim identity, target/incarnation binding, required authoritativeReads/dependencies/predicateDependencies/causalInputs, authoritative evidence boundaries, UNKNOWN for missing/non-authoritative evidence, FAIL for disproven conditions, and policyContext matching.

## Not claimed
STEP 4 runtime verification does not prove distributed fencing, universal writer participation, external-effect correctness, exactly-once, power-loss durability, or production safety.

## STEP 5 verified evidence
- Workflow run: 37785361553
- Job: 113338604779
- Commit: 8ac970ed60a94b33e5befd5ba93afa3bff2f27c4
- Conclusion: success.
- Proof: NEXO_NCS/PROOF/STEP_5_RUNTIME_VERIFICATION_2026-10-08.md

## STEP 6 boundary established
- Contract design saved in NEXO_NCS/BUILD/STEP_6_RECONCILIATION_BOUNDARY_2026-10-08.md.
- The boundary distinguishes UNKNOWN from RECONCILE_REQUIRED and forbids evidence invention or SAFE_COMMIT synthesis.
- No external-effect machinery, queues, retries, new identifiers, or hidden durable state introduced.

## Next action
Implement and runtime-verify only the minimal deterministic Reconciliation boundary. If implementation requires a new mechanism not justified by the current contract, STOP and redesign rather than patch.

## Do-not-repeat
No V1–V20 code reuse as architecture. No AB105.117R. No historical TLC/Kafka rerun. No speculative transaction wrappers, run IDs, effect tombstones, deferred queues, compatibility layers, or external-effect machinery without a current construction contract requiring them.
