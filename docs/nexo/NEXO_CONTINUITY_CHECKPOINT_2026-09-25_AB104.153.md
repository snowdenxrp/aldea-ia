# NEXO — CONTINUITY CHECKPOINT AB104.153
Date: 2026-09-25
Status: RESEARCH / CLEAN ARCHITECTURE PRECONDITION. No V21.

## Completed
Saved and reviewed:
docs/nexo/NEXO_MULTI_RESOURCE_UNKNOWN_PARTIAL_COMMIT_RECOVERY_RESTART_RESEARCH_V1_2026-09-25.md

Core result:
- Multi-resource state must remain participant-aware.
- A=CONFIRMED, B=UNKNOWN is a real partial-commit state, not global FAILURE.
- Resource replacement creates a new incarnation unless explicit continuity is proven.
- Recovery restart creates a new recovery incarnation and must reacquire current ownership/fence.
- STOP changes invalidate affected pending retry/compensation/release decisions.
- Late evidence is historical unless current context and resource incarnation validate promotion.
- Compensation/retry remain effect-class-specific.
- Partial commit + unresolved participant + changed incarnation/stale context defaults to HOLD/QUARANTINE for nontrivial effects until reconciliation establishes admissibility.

## AB104.151/152 carryover
Execution-owner boundary remains undefined and implementation remains blocked.
persistPreparedIntent is a hook, not yet an integrated durable transaction boundary.
No current CI PASS is claimed.

## Historical residuals preserved
AB50→AB58:
TERNARY_MATH_GAP FOUND
TERNARY_PROTOCOL_RESIDUAL UNKNOWN_DUE_TO_MISSING_SEMANTICS
TERNARY_PAA_COLLISION UNKNOWN
EVENTDAG_CLOSURE PARTIAL
RECONSTRUCTION BOUNDED_ONLY
SEMANTIC_FREEZE NOT_DECLARED
FORMAL_VERIFICATION/IMPLEMENTATION_NOT_PERFORMED

## DO-NOT-REPEAT
Do not collapse participant outcomes.
Do not treat resource replacement as continuity without proof.
Do not restore recovery authority from checkpoint.
Do not treat STOP as external outcome resolution.
Do not infer external exactly-once from local idempotency.
Do not wire executor before execution-owner contract.
Do not claim tests/CI passed without fresh evidence.
Do not implement V21 or delete historical gaps.

## EXACT NEXT ACTION
Audit the execution-owner contract against the multi-resource model. Determine the minimum protected ownership/persistence boundary and crash semantics before any implementation.
